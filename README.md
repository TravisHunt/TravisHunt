# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Travis Hunt
I'm a software developer/engineer with 6 years experience in the web development space, though I'm interested in a wide vareity of subjects.

I'm currentlying working on a web application for aggregating and organizing music from multiple streaming services into individual playlists to serve my music needs
as the GM of my TTRPG group. The back-end is a RESTful API, built with Flask, sitting on top of MongoDB. The front-end is being built entirely with vanilla JavaScript,
and Jinja-rendered html templates.

I am extremely interested in Python at the moment, and am on the look out for cool collaboration opportunities!
