# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Travis
I'm a software engineer with 8 years experience in the web development space, though I'm interested in a wide vareity of subjects.

My most recent project is a web application for aggregating and organizing music from multiple streaming services into individual playlists to serve my music needs
as the GM of my TTRPG group. The back-end is a RESTful API, built with Flask, sitting on top of MongoDB. The front-end is being built entirely with vanilla JavaScript,
and Jinja-rendered html templates.
